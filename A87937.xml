            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He receipt of yours brought with it much contentment, in that I underſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the condition of Affaires in your Parts, But as to ſatisfying that part of your Letter, which requeſts me to give you a like account of our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, and what my opinion is of an engagement in this new War, I muſt plead an utter diſability; Yet to ſhew you what a ſupremacy of power you have over me, or rather what vertue is in your Command, I have given you my ſlender ſenſe, which though it be not flouriſhed by a Rhetoricall pen, yet I'le aſſure you it comes from an uncorrupted heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115163:3"/>You may remember, at the beginning of the late War, when you engaged your perſon, and I my purſe for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> how many Declarations were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the <hi>Parliament</hi> of their reall intentions, to ſettle <hi>Religion</hi> in its purity, to make the <hi>King</hi> a glorious King, to Eſtabliſh a firme Peace, &amp;c. All which were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by thoſe ſacred ligaments, the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> which made me (I muſt confeſſe) for ſome time a great admirer of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and their proceedings. When the War grew towards an end, and that the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Party was expulſed, I found ſenſibly in all parts of the Kingdom a working Factious party of <hi>Independents,</hi> (and you know what thoſe are, a <hi>Gallemaufry</hi> of all <hi>Sects</hi> blended together) theſe (by the power and inſtigation of the two Generalls, who had the Sword in their hands, and of ſome prevalent Members in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) ſcru'd themſelves into all Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had their <hi>Levites</hi> in all Counties, eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> to poyſon the people with their Doctrine; and indeed, began to be, and actually were, as violent againſt us, (whom the world call <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) as againſt the moſt rigid <hi>Cavaliers:</hi> witneſſe the expelling the 7 <hi>Lords</hi> and the 11 <hi>Members,</hi> the impriſoning the <hi>Lord Major and Aldermen,</hi> with diverſe other worthy Gentlemen and Commanders: And inſtead of ſettling Peace, an Army was kept on foot, meerly to awe and tyrannize over the Kingdome, and though ſome Forces were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded in ſeverall Counties, yet they were ſuch onely, as that prevailing Faction could not confide in.</p>
            <p>Yet when the world began to ſee what an <hi>Independent Idoll</hi> they were ſetting up, then ever &amp; anon the <hi>Members</hi> would ſet out ſome <hi>Ordinance</hi> or other Papers, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115163:3"/>
ſhould blinde the people with a belief, that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſettle <hi>Church-Government</hi> and Treat with the <hi>King;</hi> when the truth is, they (like watermen) look'd one way and row'd another, as little intending either of thoſe, as any good to our Party.</p>
            <p>But (Sir) the people (I ſay) thus perceiving which way this worme of <hi>Independencie</hi> began to gnaw, this City, and the Countries adjacent Petitioned for a <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Treaty,</hi> (and you have heard what uſage the <hi>Surrey Petitioners</hi> found at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> among thoſe bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds of the then Guard) nay, when they faw how their Petitions were ſleighted, and their Petitioners abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Kent</hi> Armes, and then <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grandees at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (ſeeing the diſ-affection of the generality of the people to their deſigne, and that our Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> were reſolved to come in to our aſſiſtance;) began to turne Cat in pan, and fawne upon us again, hoping to make a <hi>Syncretiſme,</hi> a conjunction of theſe two Parties againſt the Common Enemy, as they call the profeſſed <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> knowing themſelves too weak to deal both with the <hi>Scots</hi> and them. To this purpoſe they re-call their Votes againſt the 7 <hi>Lords</hi> and 10 <hi>Members,</hi> releaſe the <hi>Citizens,</hi> and others that were impriſoned; and gave particular inſtruction to ſome of their chief <hi>Miniſters</hi> about <hi>London,</hi> to call upon a re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the common Enemy in their Pulpits, and to cement the breach between them and us, as much as might be.</p>
            <p>And when their Member-ſhips perceived that this City was minded and neceſſitated in theſe new commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to name a <hi>Generall,</hi> and raiſe ſome Forces for their own preſervation, and well knowing how much the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115163:4"/>
name of an <hi>Independent</hi> is hated in their <hi>Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> and that their eyes were upon <hi>Skippon,</hi> they laid this pretty Engine to entrap the City: <hi>Skippon</hi> (who had formerly been ſleighted and laid aſide by the <hi>Army,</hi> as ſmelling too much of a <hi>Presbyter</hi>) had a good round ſumme given him, and other promiſes, ſufficient to make ſo unſtable a man one of their Neophytes; which being greedily accepted, <hi>Skippon</hi> had order to act his part thus. By any meanes not to diſcover any inclination in himſelf towards <hi>Independentiſme,</hi> till ſuch time as the <hi>City</hi> had emboſomed themſelves to him, and ſetled him in the Employment, then, and not before, to caſt off his Vizard: This he hath done to purpoſe, and abuſed the <hi>City</hi> ſufficiently, by many underhand practices, for which he has lately been called to an account by the <hi>Common Councell,</hi> and hath utterly loſt his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>Now (Sir) could theſe <hi>Grandees,</hi> withall their art and daubing, and with their money-baites, make us take the hook; and ſo by enduring the Duſt and Sun, quiet the preſent diſtempers, as we did the former, we ſhould ſoon be in our former Condition, the Army would be again brought to <hi>London,</hi> to awe the Parliament, our cheif and uncorrupted Members re-expelled, our Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens re-committed, and our City enſlaved.</p>
            <p>This (with much more, which might be added, were it not for exceeding the bounds of a Letter) hath made my Conſcience cleerly ſatisfied, that we ought by no meanes to adhere in this new War, to theſe <hi>Anarchiſts,</hi> theſe <hi>Babel-Builders,</hi> but rather to ſide with the Kings Party; for, though you and I perhaps may not reliſh all that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> profeſſe, yet (truſt me Sir) I think the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115163:4"/>
worſt of their tenents ought to have preference before the beſt of the <hi>Independents;</hi> and of two Evils you know, we are to chooſe the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this is not the old War, nor the old Quarrell, but new in both; the Quarrell is not now betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that for extirpating <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and evill <hi>Councellours,</hi> but betwixt the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> &amp; moſt of the <hi>Commons</hi> of the Land of the one part, and a few factious Members (puffed up with luſt and ambition) and all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of the Kingdome on the other part; and this, whether Religion or no Religion, King or no King, Law or now Law.</p>
            <p>This hath made the <hi>Scots</hi> (according to our <hi>Covenant</hi>) come into our aſſiſtance, for ſetling <hi>Church-Government</hi> and re-Enthroning the <hi>King.</hi> This hath made the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham</hi> (whom I hold to be a perſon of much Honour &amp; Conſcience) accept of the Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralſhip under the <hi>Duke of York;</hi> this made Generall <hi>Laughern</hi> and Collonell <hi>Poyer</hi> Revolt from the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe Levelling Saints. This hath made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the <hi>Mariners</hi> and <hi>Seamen</hi> Ancher their Ships in a better Haven, and their Conſciences in a better Cauſe. And this I hope hath, or will make all true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects endeavour the reſtoring of His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to His Crown and Dignity, and the deſtroying of this Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent brood, the Army and their Adherents; ſince it is now evident, that they would have no Religion, but a miſcellany of Sectaries; no King but Anarchy, no Lawes, but their own wilde and unlimitted Wills; And what a Viſitation they intend to this Famous City (if <hi>Colcheſter</hi> could once be theirs) and what Armes and other preparation their Brethren of this City make for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115163:5"/>
their aide and abetments, as it is apparently known; ſo we hope the wiſdome of the <hi>Common Councell</hi> will take ſpeedy care timouſly to prevent.</p>
            <p>This I dare ſay is the ſenſe of may thouſands in this City; For ſince the Houſes recede from their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Principles, tis good reaſon we ſhould withdraw our affections from them. In which number is</p>
